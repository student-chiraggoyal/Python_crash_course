#Escape sequence characters in Python are special characters used to represent certain whitespace characters or other special characters within strings. Here are some of the most commonly used escape sequence characters in Python along with examples:

# 1. \n: Newline character

print("Hello\tworld!")

# 3. \\: Backslash character (used to escape itself)
print("C:\\Users\\User\\Documents")

# 4. \": Double quote character (used to include double quotes inside a string declared with double quotes)
